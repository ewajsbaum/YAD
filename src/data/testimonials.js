YAD’s professional team has been attentive, approachable, always available and quick to respond to our requests. We are provided access to each member of their very qualified team, including the principal of the business. Their lease documentation is clearly written and very comprehensive, while at the same time having terms that are fairly balanced between the tenant and landlord, indicative of their desire to maintain strong relationships with their tenants. Our leasing experience with YAD has been a very positive one.",

In addition to providing a great environment for our teams to collaborate in, we have been impressed by the responsiveness of YAD’s team. They are approachable and demonstrate a strong willingness to partner together to resolve any building related issues in a timely manner. I would recommend the YAD team to anyone looking for a commercial lease. They are professional, courteous, and really understand how to run a commercial property well.",
